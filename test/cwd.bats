# Working directory tracking tests for zmx.
#
# zmx learns a session's cwd from the OSC 7 the shell emits, which arrives as a
# percent-encoded file://<host><path> URI. That URI is what `list` reports, so
# the host stays visible and you can tell an SSH session apart from a local one.
# These tests pin that output plus the thing it depends on: the URI is decoded
# for the chdir, so a new session lands in a directory whose name needed
# escaping.
